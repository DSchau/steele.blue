It's all about the benjamins.

And by benjamins, I mean Mugabea-ns.

A coworker's pastor was able to acquire a couple of these Zimbabwean bank notes and has been distributing them like wallpaper.  Wait, I can't use that metaphor anymore because it's <a href="http://www.vincentchow.net/3236/zimbabwe-money-wallpaper">actually happening</a>.

It's a depressing story, but you can find cocktail chatter here. Like how the same company that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giesecke_&amp;_Devrient#Zimbabwe_involvement">printed money for the hyperinflated Weimar Republic</a> also was pumping out Zimbabwe's notes until last year.  Or how Zimbabwe's bank has to <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/144387">churn out dollars 24/7</a> to satisfy the wheelbarows of money it takes to even get a bus ride.

Anyway, I'm not technically a 5-billionaire because the bill expired at the beginning of the year (who makes bills that expire?!)  So I'm not sure what I should do with the note. Any suggestions?
