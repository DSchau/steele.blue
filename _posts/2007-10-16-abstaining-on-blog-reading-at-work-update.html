I'm trying my damnedest to <a href="http://matthewsteele.wordpress.com/2007/10/15/no-blog-reading-at-work-for-a-week/">avoid reading any blogs</a> at work this week. On Monday I deleted my Bloglines bookmark, removed Google Reader from my iGoogle homepage, and prayed to heathen gods to give me the strength not to buckle.

Much like a Cambodian farmer or an Afghan kid looking for food rations,  I find myself unable to avoid blog landmines (I call them blandmines).  On <strong>two separate occasions</strong> today I was unable to avoid reading blog entries.

A routine trip to the restroom this morning turned <em>tragic</em> as I entered the stall and noticed someone had <strong>printed out</strong> <strong>the day's posts</strong> from <a href="http://svextra.com/blogs/gmsv/">Good Morning Silicon Valley</a>.  Uncontrollably I read several stories about <a href="http://svextra.com/blogs/gmsv/2007/10/aol_to_give_unlimited_free_time_deal_to_2000_employees.html">AOL giving an "unlimited free time" package to 2,000 of its employees,</a> and Steve Ballmer <a href="http://svextra.com/blogs/gmsv/2007/10/quoted-654.html">comparing Microsoft's products to kids in a family</a>.

Later in the afternoon, I check my email and see one of my coworkers sent me a message.  This guy, who is aware of my task, sent me a blog post <strong>emailed from Google Reader</strong>.  Apparently a <a href="http://jonaquino.blogspot.com/2007/10/svn-time-lapse-view.html">new feature in Subversion</a> is interesting enough to <em>destroy my ambition and ruin my goal</em>.

More as it develops...
