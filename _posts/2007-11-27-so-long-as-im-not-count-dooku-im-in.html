I'm a little skeptical of the news that all the cool kids in town are <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/article/20071123/ENTERTAINMENT/111230032/1007">becoming libertarians</a>:
<blockquote>Card-carrying Libertarians are few and far between. Yet, seen as the guiding philosophy of a bloc of dissatisfied, independent-minded voters whose views align with Republicans on economics and Democrats on social issues, libertarianism is palpably gathering steam.</blockquote>
This seems like one of those "well, since Drew Carey and the South Park guys are libertarians, we've got to write a story about it" articles with no empirical evidence to back it up.  Even a friggin' Cato Institute-funded study found that less than 1 in 5 Americans<a href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=6715"> adhere to libertarian principles</a>.

I did like this quote:
<blockquote>Mr. Gillespie chuckles at the dark images that talk of libertarianism inevitably conjures up. "We're the Sith Lords of American politics," he says, referring to the "Star Wars" baddies. "We can show up in any group. We're both terrifying and devilishly attractive."</blockquote>
Guilty on the latter, I'm afraid.
