My week's experiement is over, and with my 20/20 hindsight I can categorically claim that a week of no blog reading at work is not worth a hill of beans, be they lima or kidney.  Or even pinto.

Like a smoker jonesing for his next fix, I spent most of each day thinking about carrying out my vice.  I can't imagine that's helping me increase productivity, either.

I suppose the one thing I learned was how to distrust everyone around me. On more than one occasion I got sent blog postings via email, IM, or toilet stall.  By the end of the week, I got very good at recognizing blandmines before succumbing to them.

So no more continuing of this experiment.  I may try to cut down a little on blog reading during the week, but I think abandoning the little leisure time at work is probably counterproductive.
