I assume you've seen <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387808/">Idiocracy</a>.  If not, I'll wait for you to catch up with the rest of society. Ready? OK.

So you also remember Brawndo.  It's got what plants crave, i.e. electrolytes... the drink which nearly causes humanity to be extinct? Well they've made it into an <a href="http://www.brawndo.com/">energy drink</a>:

Seriously, check out the video.

Notwithstanding the obvious irony related to marketing a drink designed for consumption by futuristic <strong>morons</strong>, the concept is brilliant.  You don't even have to expend energy thinking of food ideas; just outsource that work to screenwriters, and rake in the dough.

So without further adieu, here are some foolproof ideas for profitable drinks:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Beer">Buzz Beer</a> -  show your support for both stimulants and depressants while financing Bob Barker's successor.</li>
	<li><a href="http://poetv.com/video.php?vid=3404">Schmitts Gay</a> - endorsed by Larry Craig: "Nine and a half foot taps out of ten!"</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/olde-fortran-futurama-jpg">Olde Fortran Malt Liquor</a> - for the procedural programmer in your life.</li>
</ul>
And a classic:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/08/27/futurama-fry-and-the-slurm-factory/">Soylent Cola</a> - It varies from person to person.</li>
</ul>
At least I know when I run my day job into the ground I've got a bevy of backup plans.
