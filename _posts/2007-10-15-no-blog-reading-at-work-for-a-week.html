I spend far too much time at work surfing the web and reading blogs; everything from Slashdot to Marginal Revolution to the Brazen Careerist.  Well this week I'm experimenting in not reading any blogs at work for the entire week.

And please note, this is going to be <strong>hard</strong> for me.  Like one of Pavlov's dogs, I have been conditioned to check the latest updates on The Caucus every time I compile my code. It's a fundamental shift in the <strong>way</strong> I work. By Friday I'll know whether I can do this cold turkey, or if personal development is a gene of the Sirens which forever calls to me, unattainably.

This entire experiment reminds me a lot of that Broadway Play,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City_of_New_York_vs._Homer_Simpson"> 'Checkin' In':</a>
<blockquote>[Young Celebrity]   I'm checkin' in!
[Doctors &amp; Patients]   He's checkin' in!
[Young Celebrity]   I'm checkin' in!
[Doctors &amp; Patients]   Checkin', checkin' in!
[Young Celebrity]   No more pills or alcohol, no more pot or Demorol,
No more stinking fun at all!</blockquote>
