 To me, the most frightening idea behind the Ron Paul candidacy is the number of conspiracy theorists and lunatics he's attracted.  I've blogged about this <a href="http://matthewsteele.wordpress.com/2007/11/16/ron-paul-for-the-long-haul/">before</a>.

Paul's defenders (including <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2007/11/that-nazi-ron-p.html">Andrew Sullivan</a>) that every candidate attracts some form of crazy, and that they shouldn't be held responsible for the passions of those on the fringes.  Since he's running a grassroots Internet campaign, let the nutjobs congregate as they may, as they are irrelevant to the candidate at hand.

I've always found that argument suspect; as conspiracy theorists tend to congregate around someone for a <i>reason</i>.  Tyler Cowen points out the conspiratorial nature of Paul's policies <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/12/the-monetary-ec.html">here</a>:
<blockquote>...I am discomforted by his overall anti-intellectual demeanor.  He strikes me as the kind of person who has a natural attraction to conspiracy theories... I don't doubt Paul's sincerity, but I would like to know his theory of why most economists -- even market-oriented ones -- don't agree with him on monetary policy.  I suspect he thinks he knows some secret that others do not.</blockquote>
The (libertarian) GMU economics professor closes with this: "A good rule of thumb is not to get too excited about any candidate whose actual election would make the Dow lose thousands of points."
