Recently I signed up for a friendly bet as to who would win each primary in the first month of the season.  An online version of the pool (with Iowa results!) is available here:

Check it out.

<b>Update</b>: I just realized the table looks completely broken in Internet Explorer.Â  You should have been using another browser anyway, because seriously it's 2008.
