Nerds of various shapes and sizes have a variety of choices when it comes to making gut-level choices about whom to vote for in the 2008 presidential election.  For example, if your vote lies with the candidate whose website is both standards-compliant and performant, you'd have already checked out <a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2008/02/candidates_grad.html">Yahoo's coverage</a> and cast your vote for Mike Gravel.

Until now, typography nerds have been left out in the cold.  That's why I was excited to see a few of my favorite blogs pander this increasingly crucial demographic.  In this spirit, I share these links with you:
<ul>
	<li>Scott Dadich, Wired's creative director, nearly <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2008/02/audio_scott_dadich_on_campaign.cfm">climaxes</a> over Obama's logo on the Economist podcast</li>
	<li>The designers of Obama's typeface (it's called Gotham) <a href="http://www.typography.com/ask/showBlog.php?blogID=79">review</a> Hillary and McCain's logos:

	<li>A bonus feature on the DVD for Helvetica (yes, there is a documentary) documents the origins of Gotham:

</ul>
This stuff excites me way more than I should freely admit.
