Seriously, who at the NYT comes up with headlines like "<a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/16/apple-backs-down-on-premium-prices-for-unprotected-music/index.html?ex=1350273600&amp;en=4843e39e6ce5863a&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss">Apple Backs Down on Premium Prices for Unprotected Music</a>"?

"Unprotected" is what I expect from Judd Apatow. "DRM-free" is what I expect from my music.
