an enduring source of hilarity.

Reading through The Economist from a few weeks back, I saw this snippet in their <a href="http://www.economist.com/world/na/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11455827">profile</a> of the LP's presidential candidate, Bob Barr:
<blockquote>His moralistic fervour faltered only when it came to his own conduct: twice divorced, he was once photographed licking whipped cream off the breasts of a particularly buxom woman. He says he was raising money for leukaemia research. (Well, he would, wouldn't he?)</blockquote>
I suppose it's better than <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/11/AR2006111101004.html">turning your entire body blue</a> by drinking a homemade panacea made of silver.  But here's to you, Libertarian Party.  Thanks for lowering the bar for political scandal and degradation.
