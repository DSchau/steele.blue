I've been experimenting this week with those "daily del.icio.us" posts, but I'm getting rid of them.  Those entries are polluting the page and making a mockery of my goal to only post useful/interesting content.  Think about it: Even if I write 3 posts a week, auto-posts of my bookmarks would account for <strong>seventy percent</strong> of the content here. No thanks.

If you were digging the concept or want to display stalker-like tendencies, you can grab <a href="http://del.icio.us/rss/mattsteele">the RSS feed of my bookmarks</a> and check them out in real-time.
