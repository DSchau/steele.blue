You may have seen this video making the rounds (hat tip Mark):

All things considered, it's pretty cool, though as political fan videos go, the bar's been set pretty low.  You're successful if the video you produce doesn't <em>actively harm</em> the prospects of your candidate.  I'd need to check with pollsters, but I'm fairly sure Sam Brownback dropped out of the race solely because of this video:

A <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2007/11/dissent-of-th-1.html">common criticism</a> of Ron Paul is that his supporters are rabidly and fanatically conspiratorial:
<blockquote>Try to engage the Paulistas on any subject and within 5 minutes they are talking about international bankers, the Trilateral Commission and the CFR.  And if you encourage them just a little they'll be talking about the Jews and their control of the US government, and before you know it they're off to the races.  Freemasons, Illuminati, the guy on the grassy knollâ€¦..its all there.</blockquote>
At least the <a href="http://www.libertypost.org/cgi-bin/readart.cgi?ArtNum=203305">lyrics</a> in the Ron Paul rap avoid that... right?
<blockquote>They got aircraft carriers in position to strike Iran, moving nuclear-armed planes to launch Armageddon in the middle-east. And if Cheney, and the Pentagon generals and the <strong>bankers that control him</strong> don't do it, the next president will.</blockquote>
Uh...
<blockquote>You gotta think beyond Iraq, but most of these candidates, including all of the major media darlings are <strong>globalist banker hand-puppet leaches off the major international crime syndicate, dealing the oil, dealing drugs, dealing the weapons</strong>, but you know what I'm saying Ron Paul is the real deal.</blockquote>
Not all of Ron Paul's supporters are paranoid, but he sure does seem to bring them out of the woodwork.

Now if you'll excuse me I have to go evade the black helicopters.
