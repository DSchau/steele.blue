From <a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/links/monologues/21weddingphotographer.html">McSweeney's</a>:
<blockquote>Take a look at my work: I've got a unique eye and I create a visual journal of personal moments, like your vows, during which, as a professional, I assure you I will not sigh heavily.</blockquote>
