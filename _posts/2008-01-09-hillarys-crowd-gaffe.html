If you watched Hillary's New Hampshire victory speech you probably noticed the demographic makeup of the crowd behind her.  Apparently 95% of all of her support in the state was from 18-24 year olds, which makes me wonder how the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/primaries/results/epolls/index.html#NHDEM">exit polls</a> got the demos so wrong.

Packing the crowd with young'ns was a big change from <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=14&amp;entry_id=23311">Iowa</a>, when she spoke in front of Madeline Albright, Bill Clinton, Wesley Clark, and other bigwigs.  But the crowd probably should have timed their applause to sync with the prestaged applause lines written into Hillary's speech:

At 3:08 - "We are facing a moment of so many big challenges..." *applause*
At 3:54 - "Young people who can't afford to go to college to pursue their dreams..." *wild applause*

To me, it sounds like the crowd is <i>applauding</i> the fact that college is unavailable to so many, or that the world is getting increasingly screwed up.  It's probably not a good idea to paint yourself as the candidate who succeeds (joyously!) when the system goes down the tubes.

Especially when the conventional wisdom is both that you are a super-ambitious candidate and that an economic recession will <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/reutersEdge/idUSN0958957620080109">help your party</a>.
