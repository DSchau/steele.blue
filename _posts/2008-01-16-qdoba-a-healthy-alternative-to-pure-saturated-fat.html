Occasionally, Qdoba sends me an email detailing local promotions and sales.  It's all very standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacn_(electronic)">bacn</a> stuff.

Yesterday I received an email from Qdoba with the subject "New Year's Resolution":

<a href="http://matthewsteele.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/picture-2.png" title="picture-2.png"><img src="http://matthewsteele.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/picture-2.png" alt="picture-2.png" /></a>

The email doesn't go into any detail on what <i>kind</i> of 2008 resolution I might maintain by consuming their burritos, but I assume they're reaching out to the people who are resolving this year, to finally <b>become a giant goddamn fatty</b>.

Here's the nutritional information for the most delicious entree on the menu, the Queso Steak Burrito:

I omitted the sour cream and extra cheese, because I want to eat healthy, you know?

A single burrito contains <b>1160 friggin' calories</b>; that's over half the FDA's recommended value for the entire day.  And half the DRV of fat.  And <b>110%</b> of your saturated fat intake.

And you'd better not touch that saltshaker; the burrito contains <b>103%</b> your daily recommended value of sodium.

For comparison purposes, the Burger King "Quad Stacker", which piles <b>four</b> beef patties beneath <b>eight</b> strips of bacon, has <b>100 fewer calories</b> than the Queso Steak Burrito.

There is a simple solution: eat half the burrito now, and save the rest for later.  You're getting <b>1.25 pounds</b> of food when you order the burrito.  This thing has its own gravitational pull; one does not need to consume the entire portion in one sitting.
