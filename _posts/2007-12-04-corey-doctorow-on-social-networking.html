Corey Doctorow strikes gold with "How Your Creepy Ex-Co-Workers Will Kill Facebook".  It notes my least favorite aspect of the site, the informational email with no information at all:
<blockquote>Emails from Facebook aren't helpful messages, they're eyeball bait, intended to send you off to the Facebook site, only to discover that Fred wrote "Hi again!" on your "wall." Like other "social" apps (cough eVite cough), Facebook has all the social graces of a nose-picking, hyperactive six-year-old, standing at the threshold of your attention and chanting, "I know something, I know something, I know something, won't tell you what it is!"</blockquote>
That's just nitpicking though; all a company needs to do is inject some ads into the notification emails, and they can include the actual content of a message while monetizing it.  I've always found something vaguely unsettling about social networks in the abstract, and Doctorow nails it:
<blockquote>In the real world, we don't articulate our social networks. Imagine how creepy it would be to wander into a co-worker's cubicle and discover the wall covered with tiny photos of everyone in the office, ranked by "friend" and "foe," with the top eight friends elevated to a small shrine decorated with Post-It roses and hearts.</blockquote>
As time goes on, I find the part of Facebook I use most often is the messaging functionality; simply because it provides me an easy way to make sure I'm not sending a message to an email address the person has abandoned years ago.  If that's the promise of enlightened browsing Facebook offers, I'm gonna have to pass.
