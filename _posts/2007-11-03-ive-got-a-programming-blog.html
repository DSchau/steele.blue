Here's the link: <a href="http://codinginrot26.wordpress.com">http://codinginrot26.wordpress.com</a>

It's called Coding in ROT26.  If you don't understand the title, you probably won't be interested in its content.  Essentially, I wanted a site I can use for cool stuff I discover while coding.  I wrote my first post tonight, entitled <a href="http://codinginrot26.wordpress.com/2007/11/03/screen-scraping-google-spreadsheets-exported-as-html/">Screen Scraping Google Spreadsheets exported as HTML</a>.
