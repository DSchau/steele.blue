<strong>Update:</strong> my bike was found at a pawn shop this weekend. I'm currently working with the police department to recover the bike.

Yesterday my bike went missing downtown; <strong>if you can find it, there's a cash reward</strong>.

The bike was taken from the racks on the east side of the UP building in downtown Omaha. Here's a map:

Here's a picture of the bike (sorry that it's upside down):

<li>Light blue/teal frame</li>
<li>Shimano-style pedals</li>
<li>Drop handlebars with white grip tape</li>
<li>I don't have the serial number :(</li>
</ul>
